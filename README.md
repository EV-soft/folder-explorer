# folder-explorer

A browser that focuses on the space that folders take up.

Developed with the [PHP2HTML library.](https://github.com/EV-soft/ev-soft.github.io)

The Folder Explorer project is built with the PHP2HTML library and shows how html output is generated, especially with regard to the advanced function htm_table ()

Watch / try a [demo here](https://ev-soft.work/fe/folder-explorer.php) It runs on PHP 8.1


### Description:
With Folder Explorer, you can browse files and folders on a web server and see the space required.

The file list are displayed in a table, where you can sort and filter the data.

In extended mode: content in subfolders is analyzed, so that data for the entire subtree can be displayed.

For example, you can search for a filename in the subtrees.

File/Folder space is also displayed graphically.

In simple mode: it speeds up and works like a typical browser without analyzing subfolder content.

Recently added context menus that you can activate by right-clicking on a file or folder row in the table (still demo).

Tested to run on latest PHP 8.1 (PHP 7.0 required)
